title: Citing SmartSHARK
permalink: /citation/
---

There are multiple publications on SmartSHARK and and the curation of data through releases. Depending on which tools or data from the SmartSHARK ecosystem you are using, different citations are appropriate, possibly even multiple citations to give proper credit to the people involved in different projects. This guide should help you to decide what to cite.
